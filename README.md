This project explores **unsupervised clustering techniques** for image classification, focusing on car images.  
The goal was to evaluate how different feature extraction methods impact clustering performance.

## 📂 Project Overview

- **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) with SIFT features** – used to extract keypoint-based descriptors from images.  
- **Mean Shift with HSV color features** – used to cluster images based on color distributions.  
- **Comparison of clustering performance** – across different feature extraction pipelines.  

## ⚙️ Skills & Techniques

- Feature extraction: **SIFT descriptors**, **HSV color features**  
- Unsupervised clustering: **GMM**, **Mean Shift**  
- Model evaluation and performance comparison  
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  

## 🚀 Results

- Demonstrated the effect of feature engineering on clustering performance.  
- Compared models based on accuracy and clustering quality.  
- Showed that feature choice (texture vs. color) significantly impacts classification outcomes.  

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Python**  
- **OpenCV** (for SIFT & image processing)  
- **Scikit-learn** (for clustering algorithms)  
- **NumPy / Pandas** (for data handling)  
- **Matplotlib** (for visualization)
